## Pricing Philosophy

**Why our pricing reflects our value:**

1. **Specialized Medium**: Super 8 film and Dad Cam VHS aesthetic require specialized skills and equipment that most videographers don't have.

2. **Film Costs**: Real Kodak Super 8 film stock is expensive and scarce. Each roll costs $100-150 to purchase, process, and scan.

3. **Processing Time**: Super 8 film must be sent to specialized labs and takes 4-6 weeks to process. We can't rush this.

4. **Limited Availability**: We only film 20 weddings per year to maintain quality. Scarcity = premium pricing.

5. **Zero Local Competition**: We're the ONLY Super 8 and Dad Cam wedding specialists in Rochester/Upstate NY.

6. **NYC Quality, Local Prices**: Competitors in NYC charge $4,000-$8,000 for similar services. Our prices are 20-30% lower while offering comparable quality.

## FAQ About Pricing

**Q: Can we negotiate the price?**
A: Our pricing reflects the rarity and cost of analog film, specialized equipment, and limited availability. We occasionally offer 10% off for off-season dates (January-March).

**Q: What if we only want 4 hours of coverage?**
A: Our packages are designed for optimal storytelling. We don't offer shorter packages because we can't tell your full story in less time.

**Q: Do you offer payment plans?**
A: Yes! 50% deposit due at booking, remaining 50% due 30 days before your wedding. For bookings 12+ months out, we can discuss custom payment plans.

**Q: What if our wedding is cancelled?**
A: Deposits are non-refundable but can be transferred to another date within 18 months.

**Q: Do you charge extra for overtime?**
A: If your reception runs longer than expected, we'll stay for key moments (sendoff, last dance) at no extra charge. Planned additional coverage is quoted separately.
