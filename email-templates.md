Hi [Name],

Just wanted to check in and see if you had any questions about the proposal I sent over for your [date] wedding.

## Template 8: Price Objection Handling

**Subject:** Re: Nightfox Films Pricing

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

Thanks for being upfront about the pricing—I totally appreciate the honesty!

I get it. Wedding videography (especially on real film) is an investment, and I want to make sure you understand what you're paying for.

**Here's why our pricing reflects our value:**

1. **Real film isn't cheap.** Super 8 film costs $100-150 per roll to purchase, process, and scan. We include 2 rolls in our base package, which is $200-300 in film costs alone before we even start editing.

2. **You're paying for rarity.** We're the ONLY Super 8/analog film specialists in Rochester/Upstate NY. Most videographers can't do what we do because they don't have the equipment, expertise, or access to film processing labs.

3. **You own everything.** Raw footage, final film, all digital files—no paywalls, no extra fees. Some videographers charge separately for raw footage ($500-1,000).

4. **Limited availability.** We only film 20 weddings per year, which means we can give your film the time and attention it deserves.

**That said, I understand if it's outside your budget.** A few options:

- **Option 1:** Our **Modern Digital package starts at $2,200** and gives you comprehensive 4K coverage without the film costs. It's still "nostalgically correct" and beautifully edited.

- **Option 2:** If you're set on Super 8, we could **reduce coverage** (fewer rolls of film) to bring the price down.

- **Option 3:** If you book an **off-season date (January-March)**, I can offer 10% off.

Let me know if any of those options work, or if there's a budget number you had in mind and we can see if there's a way to make it work.

No pressure either way—I want you to feel great about your decision!

## Template 9: Referral Request (Send 2 weeks after film delivery)

**Subject:** Quick favor? ❤️

**Body:**

Hi [Name]!

Now that you've had a couple weeks to live with your wedding film, I wanted to check in and see how you're feeling about it.

(Also, I hope married life is treating you well! 🎉)

**If you're loving your film, I have a small favor to ask:**

Would you mind leaving us a review on Google? It takes 2 minutes, but it means THE WORLD to us. Reviews are how future couples find us, and hearing your experience helps them feel confident booking.

**Leave a review here:** [Google My Business review link]

**Also, if you know any engaged couples** who might be interested in Super 8/analog film, we'd love to work with them! As a thank-you, we'll send you a $200 credit toward any future Nightfox Films project (anniversary shoot, family film, etc.).

Thanks again for trusting us with your wedding day. Your film is one of my favorites from this year, and I'm so glad we got to be a part of your story.

## Pro Tips

1. **Use their name.** Personalize every email—no generic "Dear Bride" nonsense.

2. **Ask questions.** Get them talking about their wedding. The more they share, the more invested they become.

3. **Create urgency (authentically).** If you really are talking to another couple about their date, say so. If not, don't lie.

4. **Show personality.** Your emails should sound like you, not a corporation. Be warm, friendly, conversational.

5. **Make it easy to say yes.** Clear next steps, booking links, calendar embeds, payment options—remove all friction.

6. **Follow up.** Most couples don't book after the first email. Have a follow-up plan (see lead nurture sequence).

7. **Mobile-optimize.** 70% of email opens are on mobile. Keep emails short, scannable, with clear CTAs.

## Tracking Success

**Metrics to monitor:**
- Response time (aim for <1 hour)
- Response rate (how many inquiries respond to your first email?)
- Consultation booking rate (how many emails lead to calls?)
- Proposal-to-booking rate (how many proposals convert?)

**Goal:**
- 80%+ response rate to initial inquiry
- 60%+ consultation booking rate
- 50%+ proposal-to-booking rate

If you're hitting these numbers, your emails are working. If not, test new copy.
