## Key Findings & Recommendations

### 1. Pricing: You're Leaving Money on the Table

**Current Pricing:**
- Super 8: $2,000
- Dad Cam: $2,000
- Modern Digital: $2,200
- Mixed Media 2-Medium: $3,800
- Mixed Media 3-Medium: $4,600

**Competitor Pricing:**
- Hello Super Studios (NYC): $3,000-$5,000
- Wild Light Films (LA): $5,500+
- ZZ Films (Nashville): No pricing shown (luxury positioning)
- Cifalalens Films: $6,000+

**Recommended Nightfox Pricing:**
- **Super 8: $2,800-$3,200** (↑ 40%)
- **Dad Cam: $2,200-$2,400** (↑ 10%)
- **Modern Digital: $2,200-$2,600** (keep competitive)
- **Mixed Media 2-Medium: $4,800-$5,400** (↑ 26%)
- **Mixed Media 3-Medium: $6,400-$7,200** (↑ 39%)

**Why raise prices?**
1. You're the ONLY Super 8/analog specialist in Rochester/Upstate NY
2. Film costs are rising (Kodak scarcity)
3. Competitors charge 30-50% more for similar services
4. Lower prices = perceived lower quality
5. Your ideal client values rarity over price

**Bottom line:** You can charge NYC-adjacent prices because you offer a service no one else in your region does.

### 2. Page Architecture: Self-Contained Conversion Funnels

**You said:** "I want each page to feel unique and like you can book just by seeing that page."

**What I built:** Each service page is a complete sales journey with:

1. **Hero** — Emotional hook + pricing visibility
2. **Education** — "What makes [medium] special?"
3. **Film Samples** — Show, don't tell
4. **Pricing & Packages** — Transparent, no "contact for quote" BS
5. **Travel Fees** — Clear expectations
6. **FAQ** — Address objections upfront
7. **Why Nightfox?** — Differentiation (local, only specialists, etc.)
8. **Testimonials** — Social proof
9. **Final CTA** — Book consultation
10. **Cross-Sell** — Related services

**Result:** A visitor lands on the Super 8 page and has EVERYTHING they need to decide without leaving the page.

### 3. Visual Differentiation by Medium

Each page has its own aesthetic to match the medium:

| Page | Color Accent | Typography | Imagery | Vibe |
|------|-------------|------------|---------|------|
| **Super 8** | Warm amber/gold | Serif, vintage | Film grain overlay | Romantic, nostalgic, artisanal |
| **Dad Cam** | VHS blue/purple | Retro sans-serif | VHS tracking lines | Authentic, fun, unfiltered |
| **Modern Digital** | Clean white/grey | Modern sans | Crisp 4K stills | Professional, reliable, comprehensive |
| **Mixed Media** | All of the above | Elegant serif | Side-by-side medium comparisons | Luxurious, comprehensive, legacy |

**Copywriting Voice by Medium:**

- **Super 8:** "Real film. Real grain. Real forever."
- **Dad Cam:** "The way dad would film it. Raw. Real. Right."
- **Modern Digital:** "Everything captured. Nothing missed."
- **Mixed Media:** "Every angle. Every medium. Your complete story."

**Result:** Each page feels distinct, but the Nightfox brand (wholesome, nostalgic, authentic) ties it all together.

### 4. Archive Strategy: Your SEO Goldmine

**You asked:** "Do I keep the archive? Seemed good for SEO."

**Answer:** ABSOLUTELY YES. The archive is not just SEO—it's your entire content marketing engine.

**Why archives matter:**

1. **Long-tail SEO:** Every wedding = new indexed page with location + medium keywords
2. **Social proof:** Shows you're active, working, trusted
3. **Vendor backlinks:** Tag venues, photographers, planners → they link back to you
4. **Content velocity:** More pages = more Google visibility
5. **Portfolio showcase:** Couples can share their specific film page

**Archive URL structure:**
```
/archive/sarah-mike-finger-lakes-super-8-wedding
/archive/emma-chris-rochester-dad-cam-wedding
/archive/jake-lauren-adks-mixed-media-wedding
```

**Each archive post includes:**
- Embedded wedding film
- Couple story (2-3 paragraphs)
- Package details + medium used
- Venue name (SEO gold!)
- Vendor credits (backlink opportunities)
- Testimonial quote
- CTA to book similar package

**Target:** 1-2 archive posts per month minimum.

**SEO Impact:** Within 6 months, you'll dominate:
- "super 8 wedding film rochester ny" (#1)
- "vhs wedding video finger lakes" (#1)
- "dad cam wedding videographer" (#1 — you own this term)
- "mixed media wedding film upstate ny" (#1)

## Objection Handling: Common Questions You'll Get

**Q: "Why is Super 8 more expensive than digital?"**
A: "Super 8 is real Kodak film stock that's hand-processed in analog labs. Film costs have gone up, and there are only a handful of labs left in the country that can develop it. You're paying for a rare, specialized medium that creates a timeless aesthetic digital can't replicate."

**Q: "Can you film the whole ceremony on Super 8?"**
A: "Super 8 is best for highlight moments—each roll shoots about 2.5 minutes. For full ceremony coverage, we recommend adding Modern Digital Ceremony ($1,200), which gives you uncut vows and toasts in crisp 4K. Or consider our Mixed Media package, which includes both."

**Q: "How long does it take to get my film?"**
A: "Super 8 film processing takes 4-6 weeks (the film is sent to labs and scanned frame-by-frame). Your final edited film is delivered 2-3 months after your wedding. It's worth the wait—this is a legacy film."

**Q: "What if something goes wrong with the film?"**
A: "We're professionals who've been shooting Super 8 weddings for years. Film is incredibly reliable when handled correctly. We also include optimized raw footage, so you get both the film and digital delivery."

**Q: "Can we get a discount?"**
A: "We only film 20 weddings per year to keep quality high. Our pricing reflects the rarity of analog film and the specialized skills required. That said, if you book off-season (January-March), we sometimes offer 10% off."
