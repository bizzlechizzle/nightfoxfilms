**Caption:**

Meet Jess & Bry 👋

We're the husband-and-wife team behind Nightfox Films, and we're obsessed with one thing: filming weddings on real film.

Super 8. VHS. Mixed media. The stuff that looks like your parents' wedding videos—grain, warmth, nostalgia, all of it.

We're based in Rochester, NY, and we're the only team in Upstate NY doing analog film wedding videography.

If you're getting married and want a film that feels timeless (not trendy), let's chat.

📧 Link in bio to see our work + book a consultation.

### **Day 5 (Friday) - SUPER 8 FILM SAMPLE**

**Post Type:** Reel (30-60 sec Super 8 clip from recent wedding)

**Caption:**
```
This is what Super 8 film looks like. 🎞️

Real Kodak film stock. Hand-processed in analog labs. Grain you can't fake.

Sarah & Mike got married at Bristol Harbour on Canandaigua Lake, and they wanted their film to feel nostalgic—like something you'd find tucked away in an old photo album.

We shot 3 rolls of film throughout their day. This is one of our favorite moments.

## Week 2: Education + Behind-the-Scenes

### **Day 8 (Monday) - EDUCATIONAL POST**

**Post Type:** Carousel (educational)

**Slide 1:** "What is Super 8 film?"
**Slide 2:** "It's real Kodak film stock—not a digital filter."
**Slide 3:** "Each roll shoots ~2.5 minutes of footage."
**Slide 4:** "We send it to labs for hand-processing."
**Slide 5:** "The grain, warmth, and texture are baked into the medium."
**Slide 6:** "That's why it looks timeless."

**Caption:**
```
Couples ask us all the time: "What actually IS Super 8?"

Here's the quick answer:

Super 8 is real film—the same stuff your parents' wedding was filmed on. We shoot it on vintage cameras, send it to specialized labs for hand-processing, and have it scanned frame-by-frame.

The grain? The warmth? The nostalgic texture? That's all from the film itself. Not a filter. Not digital. The real thing.

And here's the cool part: film doesn't age. It's classic from day one.

### **Day 10 (Wednesday) - BEHIND-THE-SCENES**

**Post Type:** Photo/Video (you holding Super 8 camera at a wedding)

**Caption:**
```
Behind the scenes at last weekend's wedding 📹

This is our Canon 814 XL-S—one of the best Super 8 cameras ever made. We use it for low-light shots (like receptions and golden hour).

Fun fact: These cameras were discontinued in the 1980s. We hunt them down, refurbish them, and keep them alive for weddings like yours.

Film isn't dead—we're just keeping it weird. 🎞️

### **Day 12 (Friday) - DAD CAM SAMPLE**

**Post Type:** Reel (VHS-style clip)

**Caption:**
```
Remember your parents' wedding video? The shaky handheld shots, the VHS tracking lines, the *authentic* feeling?

That's Dad Cam.

We film your wedding like a family member would—candid, unfiltered, no staging. Just real moments as they happen.

Emma & Chris got their film on an actual VHS tape in a custom box. Their parents cried watching it.

### **Day 24 (Wednesday) - EDUCATIONAL (COMPARISON)**

**Post Type:** Carousel

**Slide 1:** "Super 8 vs Digital: What's the difference?"
**Slide 2:** "Super 8 = Real film, grain, warmth, nostalgic"
**Slide 3:** "Digital = Crisp 4K, clean, modern"
**Slide 4:** "Super 8 = Timeless (doesn't age)"
**Slide 5:** "Digital = Contemporary (trends change)"
**Slide 6:** "Both are beautiful—it's about what YOU want."

**Caption:**
```
Super 8 or Digital? Here's how to decide.

If you want:
✓ Timeless grain that doesn't age → Super 8
✓ Nostalgic warmth (like your parents' wedding) → Super 8
✓ Crisp, clean 4K footage → Digital
✓ Longer timeline coverage (60-120 min) → Digital

Or… get both with our Mixed Media packages.

Still not sure? DM us or link in bio to chat.

## Instagram Strategy

### Hashtag Strategy

**Primary (always use):**
- #nightfoxfilms (branded)
- #rochesterwedding
- #super8wedding

**Secondary (rotate based on content):**
- Location: #fingerlakeswedding #buffalowedding #adirondackwedding
- Medium: #analogfilm #vhswedding #dadcam #filmisnotdead
- Style: #vintagewedding #nostalgicwedding #timelesswedding

**Max:** 10-15 hashtags per post (hide in first comment to keep caption clean)

---

### Engagement Strategy

**Daily Tasks:**
- Respond to all comments within 2 hours
- Reply to DMs within 1 hour (inquiries are HOT)
- Engage with 10-15 Rochester wedding accounts (photographers, planners, venues)
- Like/comment on engaged couples' posts with #rochesterwedding

**Weekly Tasks:**
- Share 3-5 Stories (BTS, polls, repost client content)
- Post 1-2 Reels (highest reach)
- Engage with Rochester wedding community (tag vendors, collaborate)

---

## Reels Strategy (Highest ROI)

**Why Reels Matter:** Instagram prioritizes Reels in the algorithm. They get 3-5x more reach than static posts.

**Reel Formula:**
1. Hook (first 3 seconds) → "This is what Super 8 film looks like"
2. Show (middle) → Actual wedding footage, grain, warmth
3. CTA (end) → "Link in bio to see more"

**Trending Audio:** Use trending romantic/nostalgic songs (check Instagram Reels explore page)

**Length:** 15-30 seconds (short = more replays = more reach)

---

## Story Strategy

**Daily Stories (3-5 per day):**
- BTS at weddings (filming, equipment)
- Poll/questions ("Super 8 or Digital?")
- Repost client DMs or testimonials
- "Swipe up" links to new blog posts (if you have 10K followers)
- Countdown to availability filling up

---

## Profile Optimization

- 3-5 Stories per day

**Every Month:**
- 1-2 Archive posts (new wedding films)
- 1 Educational carousel
- 1 Engagement post (poll, question, community)

---

## Success Metrics

**Track These:**
- Follower growth (goal: +50-100/month)
- Engagement rate (goal: 3-5%)
- Profile visits (goal: 200+/month)
- Website clicks (goal: 50+/month)

**What Works:**

---

## Instagram Ads (Optional Budget: $300-500/month)

**Target Audience:**
- Age: 25-35
- Location: Rochester, Buffalo, Syracuse, Finger Lakes within 50 miles
- Interests: "Recently Engaged," "Wedding Planning," "Vintage Aesthetics," "Film Photography"

**Ad Creative:**
- Carousel of your best Super 8/Dad Cam/Mixed Media clips
- Headline: "The Only Super 8 Wedding Videographers in Upstate NY"
- CTA: "Learn More" → Link to website

**Expected Results:**
- $300/month = ~30,000 impressions, 300 clicks, 5-10 inquiries

---

## Content Creation Tips

**Batch Content:**
- Spend 1 day per month filming/editing 8-12 posts
- Schedule posts in advance (Later, Planoly, Meta Business Suite)

**Repurpose Everything:**
- Wedding film clip → Reel + Story + carousel slide
- Blog post → Carousel + Story link
- Client testimonial → Feed post + Story highlight

**Use Phone for BTS:**
- iPhone/Android quality is fine for Stories and casual posts
- Save high-quality film clips for Reels and feed posts

---

## Final Tips

1. **Consistency > Perfection** — Post 3x/week consistently beats posting 10x one week then nothing for a month

2. **Engage, don't just post** — Respond to every comment, DM, mention. Instagram rewards engagement.

3. **Show your face** — People book people, not brands. Let couples see who you are.

4. **Be authentic** — Don't overthink it. Your personality is part of what makes you unique.

5. **Track what works** — If Reels get more engagement than carousels, do more Reels.
