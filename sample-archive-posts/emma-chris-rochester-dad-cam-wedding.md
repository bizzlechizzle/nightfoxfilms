## The Story

### Headline (H2)
Every Moment, Unfiltered

### Body Copy
Emma and Chris got married in their backyard in Rochester on a rainy October afternoon, surrounded by their closest friends and family. They didn't want a polished, cinematic wedding video—they wanted something that felt real, authentic, and raw.

That's where Dad Cam came in.

We filmed their entire day handheld, VHS-style, capturing every candid moment, awkward toast, tearful hug, and spontaneous dance move. No tripods. No staging. Just real life, exactly as it happened.

The result is a 90-minute timeline edit that feels like a home video from the '90s—and that's exactly what they wanted. Emma's mom cried watching it, saying it reminded her of her own wedding video from 1992.

## The VHS Delivery

### Headline (H2)
Their Film, On Actual VHS

### Body Copy
Emma and Chris chose the VHS delivery add-on, which means their 90-minute wedding film was transferred to an actual VHS tape and delivered in a custom-designed box.

They can pop it into any VHS player and watch their wedding the way their parents watched theirs—on a TV, with tracking lines, authentic warmth, and all the nostalgia.

It's not just a digital file. It's a physical artifact. A keepsake. A family heirloom.
