## The Story

### Headline (H2)
A Golden Hour Dream on Canandaigua Lake

### Body Copy
Sarah and Mike got married at Bristol Harbour on Canandaigua Lake on a perfect September afternoon. They knew from the start they wanted their wedding filmed on real Super 8—the same way their parents' weddings were captured decades ago.

We shot 3 rolls of Kodak film throughout their day, from getting ready at The Inn on the Lake to their golden hour portraits on the vineyard grounds. The grain, the warmth, the way the light filtered through the trees—it was pure magic.

Their film is 6 minutes of timeless, nostalgic beauty that perfectly captures the joy and warmth of their celebration. Every frame feels like a memory you'd find tucked away in an old photo album, but it's all theirs.

## Behind the Scenes

### Headline (H2)
Filming This Day

### Body Copy
Filming a wedding on Super 8 is all about patience and intentionality. Each roll of film shoots for about 2.5 minutes, so we have to be strategic about what moments to capture.

For Sarah and Mike's wedding, we used:
- **Roll 1 (Indoor):** Getting ready moments, first look, ceremony details
- **Roll 2 (Outdoor):** Ceremony on the lawn, couple portraits by the lake
- **Roll 3 (Extra):** Golden hour vineyard shots, first dance, reception dancing

After the wedding, the film was sent to a specialized lab in Los Angeles for hand processing and frame-by-frame scanning. Six weeks later, we received the digitized footage and began editing their signature 6-minute film.

The result? Timeless, nostalgic, and exactly what Sarah and Mike envisioned.
