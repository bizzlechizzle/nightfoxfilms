## Your Story Section

### Headline (H2)
How We Got Here

### Body Copy

We didn't start out as wedding videographers.

Jess grew up watching her parents' wedding video on repeat—grainy VHS footage of the '80s, complete with tracking lines and her dad's terrible camcorder skills. There was something about that film that felt more real than any polished, professional video she'd ever seen.

When we got married in 2015, we knew we wanted that same feeling. But every videographer we talked to offered the same thing: sleek, cinematic, overly-produced films that looked beautiful but felt... sterile.

So we bought a Super 8 camera on eBay, learned how to shoot film ourselves, and filmed our own wedding.

The footage came back from the lab six weeks later, and when we watched it for the first time, we both cried. The grain. The warmth. The way the light hit the film. It felt exactly like the home videos we grew up watching—timeless, nostalgic, and authentic.

We knew we had to share this with other couples.

Fast forward to today: We're the only Super 8 and analog film wedding specialists in Upstate New York. We've filmed over 100 weddings on real film, VHS, and mixed media, and every single one feels like a time capsule.

We're not trying to make wedding videos look trendy or perfect. We're trying to make them feel real.

Because twenty years from now, you won't care about the latest editing trend. You'll care about hearing your vows, seeing your dad's toast, and watching your grandma dance.

That's what film gives you. And that's why we do this.

## Why Film Matters (To Us) Section

### Headline (H2)
Why We're Obsessed with Film

### Body Copy

Here's the thing: digital video is easy. It's predictable. It's safe.

But film? Film is magic.

Film forces you to be intentional. You can't just spray-and-pray with a digital camera. Every frame costs money. Every shot matters. You have to think about light, composition, and the moment you're trying to capture.

And when the footage comes back from the lab—grainy, warm, imperfect—it looks like nothing else. It feels timeless because it IS timeless.

We shoot film because:

**1. Film doesn't age.**
Digital video trends come and go. Film grain looks the same in 1975 as it does in 2025. Your wedding film will look classic forever.

**2. Film feels authentic.**
There's no over-editing, no fake color grading, no trying to make everything look "perfect." Film captures your day exactly as it was—raw, real, and beautiful.

**3. Film is rare.**
Most videographers can't shoot film because it's expensive, time-consuming, and requires specialized skills. We're one of the few teams in the country who still do it—and the ONLY ones in Upstate NY.

When we hand you your wedding film, we want it to feel like something your parents would have—a keepsake, a memory, a piece of your history that lasts forever.

## How We Work Section

### Headline (H2)
What It's Like to Work with Us

### 3 Columns

**Chill & Easygoing**
We're not the "smile at the camera" type. We're here to document your day, not direct it. You won't even notice us most of the time.

**Fly on the Wall**
We don't stage or pose you. We capture real moments as they happen—tears, laughter, chaos, and all the in-between.

**All About You**
Your wedding day is about you, not us. We're there to tell your story, not to make ourselves the center of attention.

## Personal Touch Section

### Headline (H2)
When We're Not Filming...

### Body Copy

Outside of wedding season, you can find us:

- Hiking in the Adirondacks (we're obsessed with Keene Valley and Lake Placid)
- Trying every coffee shop in Rochester (current favorite: Ugly Duck)
- Watching old movies on actual film (yes, we have a projector)
- Hunting for vintage cameras at estate sales and on eBay

We live in Rochester's South Wedge neighborhood, love anything nostalgic or analog, and believe that the best stories are told honestly, not perfectly.

If that sounds like your vibe, we'd love to work with you.
