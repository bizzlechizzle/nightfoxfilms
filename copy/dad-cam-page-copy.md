## FAQ Section

### Headline (H2)
Frequently Asked Questions About Dad Cam

### FAQs

**Q: What's the difference between Dad Cam and Modern Digital?**
A: Dad Cam is shot handheld with VHS aesthetic (tracking lines, warm tones, candid style). Modern Digital is crisp 4K with tripods/stabilizers. Both are ~60-90 min timeline edits.

**Q: Is the VHS aesthetic added in post, or real?**
A: We shoot on cameras that mimic the VHS look, then add authentic color grading and effects in post. It's not shot on actual VHS tape (too unreliable), but looks identical to the real thing.

**Q: Can I actually get my wedding on a VHS tape?**
A: Yes! For $400, we'll deliver your film on VHS (or DVD/Blu-ray) in a custom box. It plays on any VHS player.

**Q: What's "Wedding Week Dad Cam"?**
A: We send you a Dad Cam to use for 10 days around your wedding. Capture rehearsal dinner, brunch, family moments—we'll edit it all into your final film. $800.

**Q: How long does it take to get my Dad Cam film?**
A: 2-3 months after your wedding. We edit comprehensive timeline films (60-90 min), so it takes time to do right.

**Q: Can you film the ceremony on Dad Cam?**
A: Yes! Dad Cam covers your full 6-hour window, including ceremony. For uncut ceremony/speeches ($1,200 add-on), we can film multi-angle or in Modern Digital for clarity.
