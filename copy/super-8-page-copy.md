What Makes Super 8 Special?

### Body Copy
Super 8 isn't just a camera—it's real Kodak film stock, shot on vintage cameras, developed by hand, and scanned frame-by-frame to capture the warmth and grain that digital video can never replicate.

This is how your parents' wedding was filmed.
This is how your grandparents fell in love.

And now, it's your turn.

**Real Kodak Film Stock**
Not a filter. Not digital. The real thing.

**Hand-Processed**

## FAQ Section

### Headline (H2)
Frequently Asked Questions About Super 8

### FAQs

**Q: What if it rains on my wedding day?**
A: Super 8 film handles low light beautifully, and rain adds incredible mood to film. We'll adjust coverage to capture the best moments.

**Q: How much coverage does 2 rolls of film give me?**
A: Each roll shoots about 2.5 minutes of footage. With 2 rolls (1 indoor, 1 outdoor), you get ~5 minutes of highlight film covering key moments of your day.

**Q: Can I see the raw footage, or just the final film?**
A: You get both! We deliver optimized raw footage (~2.5 min per roll) PLUS your edited highlight film with music and color grading.

**Q: How long does it take to get my Super 8 film?**
A: Film processing takes 4-6 weeks (real film needs to be sent to labs and scanned). Your final edited film is delivered 2-3 months after your wedding.

**Q: Can you film the entire ceremony on Super 8?**
A: Super 8 is best for highlight moments, not full ceremonies (film rolls last ~3 minutes). We recommend adding Modern Digital Ceremony coverage ($1,200) for uncut ceremony + speeches.

**Q: What's the difference between regular Super 8 and "Super 8 with Sound"?**
A: Regular Super 8 is silent film (we add music in edit). Super 8 with Sound captures audio directly on magnetic film stock—rare, vintage, incredibly special (+$1,200).

**Q: Do you shoot digital video as backup?**
A: No. Super 8 film is the aesthetic—there's no "backup." Film is extremely reliable when shot by professionals. If you want digital coverage too, consider our Mixed Media packages.
