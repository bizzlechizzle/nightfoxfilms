## FAQ Section

### Headline (H2)
Frequently Asked Questions About Mixed Media

### FAQs

**Q: How do you decide which medium to use when?**
A: We shoot all mediums throughout the day, then edit your signature film using the medium that best tells each moment. Super 8 for golden hour, VHS for candid dancing, 4K for ceremony details—we blend it all.

**Q: Can I choose which 2 mediums for the 2-medium package?**
A: Yes! Choose any 2: Super 8 + Modern Digital, Super 8 + Dad Cam, or Dad Cam + Modern Digital. Most couples pick Super 8 + Modern Digital.

**Q: Why 2 videographers instead of 1?**
A: Shooting multiple mediums requires coordination and coverage from different angles. Two videographers ensure we capture every moment without missing anything.

**Q: How long is the final highlight film?**
A: 2 Mediums: 6+ minutes. 3 Mediums: 8+ minutes. This is a signature cinematic film, not a timeline edit.

**Q: Do I also get the full timeline edit?**
A: No, Mixed Media focuses on the signature highlight film. For full timeline coverage (60-120 min), that's a separate add-on or choose Modern Digital/Dad Cam base.

**Q: How long does it take to get my Mixed Media film?**
A: 3-4 months. We're blending Super 8 (4-6 weeks to process), VHS, and Digital, then editing a signature film that showcases all mediums seamlessly. It's worth the wait.

**Q: Is this worth it over just picking one medium?**
A: If you want the most comprehensive, cinematic, and legacy-quality film possible—yes. Mixed Media gives you every aesthetic, every angle, and a truly unique film that no one else can deliver.
