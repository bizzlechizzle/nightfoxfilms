# Competitive Analysis: Nightfox Films
**Date:** November 2025
**Analysis Focus:** Super 8, VHS/Dad Cam, and Mixed Media Wedding Videography

---

## Executive Summary

**Finding:** Nightfox Films is currently underpriced by 20-40% compared to competitors offering similar analog film services.

**Key Opportunity:** The analog wedding film market (Super 8, VHS, mixed media) is experiencing high demand with limited supply. Most competitors are based outside Rochester, creating a local market advantage.

**Recommended Action:** Increase Super 8 pricing to $2,800-$3,200 and Mixed Media to $4,800-$7,200 to align with market rates and perceived value.

   - *Counter:* Add this to Mixed Media packages or as clear add-on

13. **Partner with vintage-aesthetic vendors** (photographers, florists, planners)

---

## Conclusion

**Nightfox Films is uniquely positioned to dominate the analog wedding film market in Upstate New York.**

With zero direct local competition, a rare skill set (Super 8, VHS, mixed media), and a geographic advantage over NYC-based competitors, the primary challenge is not beating competitors—it's **being discovered** by the right couples who value nostalgic, authentic film over generic digital videography.

**The path forward:**
- Price confidently ($2,800-$7,200 range)
- Market aggressively through SEO (location + medium keywords)
- Position as the local analog film specialist
- Tell the story of why film matters

Your competitors are charging $5,500-$6,000 for services you're offering at $2,000-$4,600. That's not competitive pricing—that's leaving money on the table.

**Raise prices. Own your niche. Dominate Upstate NY.**
