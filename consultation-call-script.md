# Consultation Call Script & Framework
**Purpose:** Convert inquiries into bookings with confidence and clarity

**Duration:** 20-30 minutes

**Success Rate Goal:** 50-70% of consultations should result in bookings

---

## Pre-Call Checklist

**Before every consultation call:**

- [ ] Review their inquiry email (what package did they ask about?)
- [ ] Check if their date is available (confirm in calendar)
- [ ] Look up their venue (Google it, know the location)
- [ ] Have pricing sheet ready
- [ ] Have calendar open to discuss availability
- [ ] Be in quiet space with good connection
- [ ] Have pen/paper or note-taking app ready

**Mindset:**
- This is a conversation, not a pitch
- Your goal: Determine if you're the right fit for each other
- Listen more than you talk (70/30 rule)
- Be consultative, not salesy

---

## Call Structure (6 Phases)

### Phase 1: Build Rapport (2-3 minutes)

**Opening:**

"Hi [Name]! Thanks so much for hopping on a call with me. How are you doing?"

[Let them respond, make small talk]

"So, you're getting married [date] at [venue]—that's so exciting! How's wedding planning going so far?"

[Listen to their response, empathize, connect]

**Goal:** Get them talking, build trust, feel like friends

---

### Phase 2: Discover Their Vision (5-7 minutes)

**Ask Open-Ended Questions:**

**Q1: "What made you reach out to us specifically?"**
- Listen for: Did they find you through Super 8? Dad Cam? Mixed Media?
- This tells you their priorities and interests

**Q2: "Have you seen any wedding videos that made you say 'YES, that's what we want'?"**
- Listen for: Film aesthetic, documentary style, highlight reels, etc.
- Helps you understand their taste and expectations

**Q3: "What's most important to you in a wedding film? What do you want to feel when you watch it years from now?"**
- Listen for: Nostalgia, emotion, comprehensive coverage, artistic style
- This reveals their values (emotional vs documentary vs artistic)

**Q4: "Are you working with other vendors yet? Photographer, planner, etc.?"**
- Listen for: Vendor names (you might know them = instant credibility)
- Opportunity to offer recommendations if they need help

**Q5: "What concerns or questions do you have about filming on [Super 8/VHS/Mixed Media]?"**
- Listen for: Price, weather, film vs digital, coverage amount
- This reveals objections you'll need to address later

**Goal:** Understand their vision, priorities, and concerns before talking about your services

**Pro Tip:** Take notes during this phase. Reference their answers later ("You mentioned you want that nostalgic feeling—that's exactly what Super 8 delivers").

---

### Phase 3: Present Your Services (7-10 minutes)

**Transition:**

"Okay, so based on what you're telling me, I think [Package Name] would be perfect for you. Let me walk you through what that looks like."

**Present the Package:**

**For Super 8:**

"So our Super 8 package is built around real Kodak film—not a digital filter, but actual film that we shoot, send to a lab, and have hand-processed. Here's what's included:

- 1 videographer (that's me)
- 2 rolls of film (1 indoor, 1 outdoor)
- Each roll shoots about 2.5 minutes, so you'll get a ~5 minute highlight film
- We also give you the optimized raw footage
- Digital delivery (online gallery)

The base package starts at $2,800.

Now, Super 8 is highlights, not full coverage. We're capturing moments—golden hour, first dance, ceremony details—not every minute of your day. Think of it as a nostalgic time capsule, not a timeline edit.

**If you want more coverage**, we can add extra rolls ($400 each) or combine Super 8 with Modern Digital for ceremony and speeches ($1,200). That gives you the best of both worlds—timeless film + comprehensive coverage.

Does that make sense so far?"

[Pause, let them ask questions]

**For Dad Cam:**

"So Dad Cam is our VHS-style package. We film your entire day handheld, like a family member would—candid, authentic, no staging. You get a 60-90 minute timeline edit that feels like a home video from the '90s.

Here's what's included:

- 1 videographer
- 6 hours of coverage
- 60-90 minute timeline edit (VHS style)
- Individual clips (ceremony, toasts, dances)
- Raw footage
- Digital delivery

The base package starts at $2,200.

**The coolest part?** For an extra $400, we can deliver your film on an actual VHS tape in a custom box. It plays on any VHS player. Couples love giving this to their parents—it's incredibly nostalgic.

Sound like what you're looking for?"

**For Mixed Media:**

"So Mixed Media is our premium package—it combines Super 8, VHS, and Modern Digital into one seamless film. Here's how it works:

- 2 videographers (usually me and [partner name])
- All-day coverage (not limited to 8 hours)
- We shoot all 3 mediums throughout your day
- You get a 6-8+ minute signature highlight film that blends all the mediums
- Plus uncut ceremony and speeches, raw footage, physical delivery (flash drive + hard drive), and a date night shoot

It's basically the ultimate wedding film experience.

The 2-medium version (you pick which 2) starts at $4,800.
The 3-medium version (all of them) is $6,400.

This is for couples who can't decide between film and digital—they want both. And honestly, it's the most comprehensive way to document your day.

What do you think?"

**Goal:** Present the package clearly, address what they care about (based on Phase 2), and check for understanding.

**Pro Tip:** Don't overwhelm them with every add-on. Focus on the base package first, then mention 1-2 relevant add-ons based on what they said earlier.

---

### Phase 4: Address Objections (3-5 minutes)

**Common Objections & How to Handle:**

---

**Objection: "That's more than we budgeted for videography."**

**Response:**

"I totally get that—wedding budgets are tight, and videography wasn't even on most couples' radar until recently.

Here's how I'd think about it: Your photos freeze moments. Your film lets you relive them. Twenty years from now, you won't remember what the flowers looked like, but you'll want to hear your vows, see your dad's toast, watch your first dance.

That said, if $[price] is outside your budget, I have a couple options:

1. **Option 1:** Our Modern Digital package starts at $2,200 and gives you beautiful 4K coverage without the film costs.

2. **Option 2:** We could reduce Super 8 coverage (fewer rolls) to bring the price down.

3. **Option 3:** If you book an off-season date (January-March), I can offer 10% off.

What feels doable for you?"

**Goal:** Acknowledge their concern, reframe value, offer alternatives.

---

**Objection: "What if it rains and ruins the film?"**

**Response:**

"Great question—everyone asks this! Here's the thing: Super 8 film LOVES moody, low-light weather. Rain actually adds incredible atmosphere and texture. Some of my favorite films are from rainy weddings.

Plus, we plan coverage around weather. If it's pouring during portraits, we shoot indoors or under cover and move outdoor shots to a break in the rain.

Weather won't ruin your film—I promise. We've filmed in rain, snow, and wind, and it's always turned out beautiful."

**Goal:** Address fear with confidence and proof.

---

**Objection: "We're talking to a few other videographers. Can you send us your info so we can compare?"**

**Response:**

"Absolutely! I'll send over a proposal with all the details right after this call.

Just curious—what are you comparing us against? Like, are the other videographers also shooting on Super 8/film, or are they digital-only?"

[Listen to their response]

"Got it. Well, here's the thing: if you're comparing us to digital videographers, the pricing will look different because film has higher costs (actual film stock, processing labs, etc.). But if you're comparing us to other analog film specialists, you'll find we're actually really competitively priced—especially for being local to Rochester.

The couples who book us usually pick us because we're the ONLY ones doing Super 8/Dad Cam/Mixed Media in Upstate NY. There's literally no one else in Rochester who does what we do.

But if digital makes more sense for you, I totally get that! I just want to make sure you're comparing apples to apples."

**Goal:** Position your uniqueness, differentiate from digital competitors, plant seed that they can't get this anywhere else locally.

---

**Objection: "We need to think about it / We'll get back to you."**

**Response:**

"Of course! This is a big decision, and I want you to feel 100% confident.

Just so I know—what specifically do you need to think about? Is it budget, coverage, the medium, or something else?"

[Listen to their response]

"Okay, that makes sense. Here's what I'll do: I'll send over a proposal with all the details, plus a few sample films so you can see [Super 8/Dad Cam/Mixed Media] in action. Take your time reviewing everything.

One heads-up: [Date] is currently available, but I do have another consultation scheduled this week for that same weekend. I can hold it for you for [X days], but after that I'll need to open it back up.

Does that work?"

**Goal:** Uncover the real objection, give them space to decide, create soft urgency.

---

### Phase 5: Close the Sale (2-3 minutes)

**If they're ready to book:**

"Awesome! I'm so excited to film your wedding. Here's what happens next:

1. I'll send over a proposal and contract within the next 24 hours.
2. To officially reserve [date], I'll need a 50% deposit ($[amount]).
3. You can pay via Venmo, PayPal, check, or credit card.
4. Once I receive your signed contract and deposit, you're booked!
5. Then we'll schedule your date night shoot and start planning coverage.

Sound good?"

[Confirm next steps, send follow-up email immediately after call]

---

**If they need time:**

"No problem! Take the time you need. I'll send over the proposal, and if you have any questions, just reply to that email or text me at (585) XXX-XXXX.

I can hold [date] for you until [specific date—usually 3-5 days], but after that I'll need to release it. Fair?"

[Set clear deadline, follow up with proposal immediately]

---

**If they're not the right fit:**

"You know what, based on our conversation, I actually think [different service/vendor] might be a better fit for what you're looking for. Let me send you their info."

[Be honest if it's not a good fit—saves everyone time]

---

### Phase 6: Wrap-Up & Next Steps (1-2 minutes)

**Closing:**

"Alright, [Name], it was so great chatting with you! I'm really excited about the possibility of filming your [venue] wedding.

I'll have that proposal over to you by [time/today/tomorrow], and feel free to reach out if anything comes up.

Good luck with the rest of wedding planning—and hey, if you need vendor recommendations (photographers, florists, etc.), just let me know. I know a ton of great people in the area.

Talk soon!"
