## 💰 BUDGET BREAKDOWN

**Essential (must-have):**
- Domain: $15/year
- Hosting (Squarespace): $276/year ($23/month)
- Email platform (Mailchimp free or ConvertKit): $0-$180/year
- Contract platform (HoneyBook): $192/year ($16/month)
- **Total Essential:** ~$500-$700/year

**Recommended (nice-to-have):**
- Instagram scheduling (Later): $0-$144/year (free plan available)
- SEO tools (Ubersuggest): $120/year
- Calendly Pro: $120/year
- **Total Recommended:** +$240-$384/year

**Grand Total Budget:** $700-$1,100/year (~$60-90/month)

**ROI:** If you book just 1 extra wedding from the new website ($2,800-$6,400), you've covered 3-9 years of expenses.

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. **Launching without testing** - Test every form, link, and page before going live
2. **Not responding fast** - 50% of couples book first responder; aim for <1 hour response time
3. **Forgetting mobile** - 60% of traffic is mobile; test everything on your phone
4. **Generic copy** - Use YOUR voice, not template copy (customize everything!)
5. **No clear CTA** - Every page should have obvious next step (Book consultation, View pricing, Contact us)
6. **Hiding pricing** - Transparency builds trust; show pricing clearly
7. **Ignoring SEO** - Add alt text, meta descriptions, and optimize from day one
8. **Not collecting testimonials** - Ask EVERY client for review; social proof = bookings
9. **Inconsistent Instagram** - Post 3-5x per week minimum; consistency > perfection
10. **Not tracking metrics** - Check Google Analytics weekly; know what's working
