## What is Super 8 Film?

Super 8 is **real Kodak film stock**—the same medium your parents' or grandparents' home movies were filmed on in the 1960s-1980s.

It's not a digital filter or effect. We shoot on actual vintage Super 8 cameras, send the film to specialized labs for hand-processing, and have it scanned frame-by-frame.

**What makes Super 8 unique:**
- **Grain:** The texture and grain come from the film itself, not post-production
- **Warmth:** Natural warm tones that can't be replicated digitally
- **Nostalgia:** Looks identical to films from 40+ years ago
- **Scarcity:** Very few videographers still shoot real film

---

## What is Digital Wedding Video?

Digital wedding videography is shot on modern 4K cameras, edited digitally, and delivered as digital files.

**What makes digital unique:**
- **Clarity:** Crisp, sharp, high-resolution footage
- **Comprehensive:** Can film hours of content without running out of "film"
- **Flexibility:** Easy to edit, color grade, and adjust
- **Immediate:** No waiting for film processing

---

## Super 8 vs Digital: 8 Key Differences

### 1. Aesthetic & Visual Style

**Super 8:**
- Grainy, warm, nostalgic texture
- Soft focus, natural light bloom
- Film grain visible (intentional, part of the charm)
- Looks timeless—won't feel "dated" in 20 years
- Imperfect (and that's what makes it beautiful)

**Digital:**
- Crisp, clean, sharp 4K resolution
- No grain (unless added in post)
- True-to-life colors
- Contemporary aesthetic
- Polished and "perfect"

**Winner:** Depends on your style preference
- Choose Super 8 if you want nostalgic, timeless
- Choose Digital if you want crisp, modern

---

### 2. Coverage & Film Length

**Super 8:**
- Each roll shoots ~2.5 minutes of footage
- Base package = 2 rolls = ~5 minutes of highlights
- Extra rolls = $400 each
- Best for capturing key moments, not full events
- Think: wedding trailer, not full ceremony

**Digital:**
- Can shoot hours of footage
- Base package = 60-120 minute timeline edit
- No limitations on how much we can shoot
- Captures full ceremony, toasts, dances, everything
- Think: comprehensive documentary

**Winner:** Digital (if you want full coverage)
- Super 8 is highlights only
- If you want uncut ceremony, add Modern Digital or choose Mixed Media

---

### 3. Cost

**Super 8:**
- Starting at $2,800
- Film costs ~$100-150 per roll to buy, process, and scan
- Extra rolls = $400 each
- Processing labs are rare and expensive

**Digital:**
- Starting at $2,200
- No film processing costs
- Can shoot unlimited footage
- More affordable for budget-conscious couples

**Winner:** Digital (lower cost)
- Super 8 is premium-priced because film itself is expensive

---

### 4. Processing & Delivery Time

**Super 8:**
- Film must be sent to labs for hand-processing
- Processing takes 4-6 weeks
- Final edited film delivered 2-3 months after wedding
- Can't be rushed (film processing is manual)

**Digital:**
- Footage available immediately after wedding
- Editing takes 2-3 months
- Faster turnaround possible if needed

**Winner:** Digital (faster processing)
- Super 8 requires patience (but it's worth it!)

---

### 5. Audio & Sound

**Super 8:**
- **Regular Super 8:** Silent film (we add music in edit)
- **Super 8 with Sound (+$1,200):** Magnetic audio on film stock (rare, vintage)
- No built-in audio recording

**Digital:**
- Full audio recorded (ceremony, toasts, vows)
- Multiple microphones for best sound quality
- Audio synced with video automatically

**Winner:** Digital (if audio matters to you)
- If you want to hear vows/toasts, choose Digital or add it to Super 8

---

### 6. Weather & Lighting

**Super 8:**
- **Loves** low light and moody weather
- Rain adds incredible atmosphere
- Golden hour = magical on film
- Film grain hides imperfections (rain drops, etc.)

**Digital:**
- Works in all conditions
- Better in bright light (4K shows everything)
- Rain can be distracting on crisp digital footage

**Winner:** Super 8 (for moody/rainy weddings)
- Film handles weather beautifully

---

### 7. Aging & Longevity

**Super 8:**
- **Timeless:** Film doesn't "age" visually
- Looks the same in 2025 as it will in 2045
- Classic aesthetic from day one
- Won't feel "dated" as trends change

**Digital:**
- **Contemporary:** Looks modern now, but trends change
- 4K footage from 2010s already looks "dated" compared to current styles
- Color grading trends shift every 5-10 years

**Winner:** Super 8 (timeless aesthetic)
- Film is classic forever

---

### 8. Flexibility & Editing

**Super 8:**
- Limited to what's shot on film (can't reshoot)
- Less flexibility in editing
- Grain and imperfections can't be "fixed"
- What you see is what you get

**Digital:**
- Unlimited takes and angles
- Full editing flexibility (color, speed, effects)
- Can adjust brightness, contrast, etc. in post
- Easy to create multiple versions (long edit, short edit, social media clips)

**Winner:** Digital (more flexible)

### Couple 1: Sarah & Mike (Chose Super 8)

"We didn't get full ceremony coverage on film, but we added Modern Digital for that. Worth it."

**Result:** 6-minute Super 8 highlight film + uncut digital ceremony

---

### Couple 2: Emma & Chris (Chose Digital)

**Why they chose Digital:**
"We wanted to hear our vows and see every moment—getting ready, ceremony, all the toasts, first dances, everything. Digital gave us that comprehensive coverage."

**What they sacrificed:**

## Common Questions: Super 8 vs Digital

### Q: Can I add Super 8 to a digital package later?

**A:** Unfortunately, no. Super 8 has to be shot on your wedding day—it can't be added in post-production.

If you're on the fence, book Mixed Media to get both.

---

### Q: Will Super 8 look good on modern TVs/devices?

**A:** Yes! All Super 8 footage is scanned digitally and delivered as MP4 files that work on any device (phones, computers, TVs, etc.).

---

### Q: Is Super 8 more "risky" than digital?

**A:** Not when shot by professionals. We've been shooting Super 8 weddings for 8+ years and have never had a roll "fail" or come back blank.

Film is extremely reliable when handled correctly.

---

### Q: Can you make digital footage look like Super 8?

**A:** Sort of. You can add grain and color grading in post, but it never looks identical to real film. The grain texture, light bloom, and imperfections of real film can't be fully replicated.

If you want the Super 8 aesthetic, shoot on Super 8.

---
