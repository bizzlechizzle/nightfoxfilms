## How to Use This Questionnaire

### Best Practices:
1. **Send 60 days before wedding** (gives couples time to fill it out, gives you time to review)
2. **Follow up if no response** after 1 week
3. **Review thoroughly** and note any red flags or special requests
4. **Follow up with phone call** 30 days before wedding to clarify details
5. **Share with 2nd videographer** (if applicable) so they're aware of priorities

### Red Flags to Watch For:
- Vague answers to "must-have moments" (means they haven't thought it through—dig deeper)
- Complicated family dynamics (be extra careful with family photos/dances)
- Overly specific shot requests (may indicate they want more direction than you typically give)
- Timeline gaps or unrealistic timings (address this proactively)

### Platform Options:
- **Google Forms:** Free, easy to use, responses go to spreadsheet
- **Typeform:** Beautiful UI, conditional logic, $25/month
- **HoneyBook:** Built-in questionnaires, $16/month (includes CRM, contracts, invoices)
- **Email:** Just copy/paste questions into email (manual but works)

### Integration with Workflow:
1. Send questionnaire (60 days out)
2. Review responses (within 1 week)
3. Follow-up call (30 days out)
4. Create shot list based on responses
5. Share with 2nd videographer
6. Arrive on wedding day fully prepared
