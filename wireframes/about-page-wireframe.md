## Why the About Page Matters

**Couples don't book businesses. They book people.**

The About page is where you build trust, show personality, and prove you're the right fit for their wedding.

**Key questions couples have:**
- Who will actually be filming my wedding?
- Why do they care about film vs digital?
- Can I trust them with my once-in-a-lifetime day?
- Do they "get" me and my vibe?

**Storytelling Tips:**
- Start with a hook ("We didn't start out as wedding videographers...")
- Share a moment that changed everything (first time seeing Super 8 footage, watching parents' wedding videos, etc.)
- Make it personal and authentic—not a corporate bio
- End with your mission ("Now we help couples...")

│  Here's the thing: digital video is easy. It's predictable.  │
│  It's safe.                                                   │
│                                                               │
│  But film? Film is magic.                                    │
│                                                               │
│  [2-3 paragraphs about why you chose to specialize in        │
│   analog film—the grain, the warmth, the nostalgia, the      │
│   intentionality, the rarity]                                │
│                                                               │
│  When we hand you your wedding film, we want it to feel      │
│  like something your parents would have—timeless,            │
│  authentic, real.                                             │
│                                                               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Points to Hit:**
- Why film over digital (emotional, not technical)
- What draws you to analog aesthetics
- How it connects to nostalgia/family history
- Why you only film 20 weddings per year (quality over quantity)
