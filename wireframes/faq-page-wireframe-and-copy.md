## GENERAL QUESTIONS

### Q: Where are you based, and where do you film?

**A:** We're based in Rochester, NY, and we film weddings throughout Upstate New York.

**Our service area:**
- **Rochester:** Included in all packages
- **Buffalo, Syracuse, Finger Lakes:** +$200 travel fee
- **Adirondacks, Hudson Valley:** +$600 travel fee
- **Everywhere else:** Custom travel fee

We've filmed at venues across the Finger Lakes, ADKs, Hudson Valley, and beyond. If your venue is outside our typical range, just ask—we love traveling for weddings!

---

### Q: How far in advance should we book?

**A:** Most couples book 8-12 months in advance. Mixed Media packages tend to book earliest (10-14 months out) because we only offer them for 10-15 weddings per year.

We only film 20 weddings total per year to keep quality high, so if your date is during peak season (May-October), we recommend booking as soon as possible.

---

### Q: Do you film weddings outside of New York?

**A:** Yes! We've filmed weddings in Vermont, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and beyond. For out-of-state weddings, we'll provide a custom travel quote based on distance and logistics.

---

### Q: What's your filming style?

**A:** Documentary and observational. We're "fly on the wall" videographers—we capture real moments as they happen without staging or directing you.

You won't feel like you're being followed around by a camera crew. Most couples tell us they barely noticed us on their wedding day (which is exactly what we want!).

---

### Q: Do you offer photo + video packages?

**A:** We focus exclusively on video, but we work with amazing photographers in the Rochester/Upstate NY area and can recommend trusted partners.

---

## SUPER 8 FILM QUESTIONS

### Q: What is Super 8 film, exactly?

**A:** Super 8 is real Kodak film stock—the same medium your parents' or grandparents' home movies were filmed on in the 1960s-1980s.

It's not a digital filter or effect. We shoot on actual vintage Super 8 cameras, send the film to specialized labs for hand-processing, and have it scanned frame-by-frame.

The grain, warmth, and nostalgic texture you see in Super 8 footage comes from the film itself, not from post-production.

---

### Q: How much coverage does Super 8 provide?

**A:** Each roll of Super 8 film shoots approximately 2.5 minutes of footage.

Our base Super 8 package includes **2 rolls** (1 indoor, 1 outdoor), which gives you about **5 minutes** of edited highlight film.

If you want more coverage, you can add extra rolls for $400 each.

---

### Q: What if it rains on my wedding day?

**A:** Super 8 film loves moody, low-light weather! Rain actually adds incredible atmosphere and texture to film.

We plan coverage around weather conditions—if it's pouring during outdoor portraits, we'll shoot indoors or under cover and adjust timing for outdoor shots when there's a break in the rain.

Some of our favorite films have been from rainy weddings.

---

### Q: How long does it take to get my Super 8 film?

**A:** Film processing takes 4-6 weeks (the film must be sent to specialized labs and scanned frame-by-frame). Your final edited film is delivered 2-3 months after your wedding.

We know that's longer than digital, but hand-processing film can't be rushed. It's worth the wait!

---

### Q: Can you film my entire ceremony on Super 8?

**A:** Super 8 is best for highlight moments, not full ceremony coverage. Each roll shoots about 2.5 minutes, so filming an entire 30-minute ceremony would require 12+ rolls of film ($4,800+ just in film costs).

**We recommend two options:**
1. Use Super 8 for ceremony highlights (vows, kiss, key moments) + Modern Digital for full uncut ceremony ($1,200 add-on)
2. Book our Mixed Media package, which includes both Super 8 highlights + full digital ceremony coverage

---

### Q: What's the difference between regular Super 8 and "Super 8 with Sound"?

**A:** Regular Super 8 is **silent film**. We add music in post-production when editing your highlight film.

**Super 8 with Sound** ($1,200 add-on) uses magnetic film stock that records audio directly onto the film. It's incredibly rare, vintage, and creates an authentic "live audio" Super 8 experience.

Most couples choose regular Super 8 (silent) because it's more affordable and we can edit it to your favorite song.

---

### Q: Do you shoot digital video as backup?

**A:** No. When you book Super 8, you're getting Super 8. Film is extremely reliable when shot by professionals—we've never had a roll "fail" or come back blank.

If you want both film and digital, check out our **Mixed Media packages**, which give you Super 8 + Modern Digital coverage.

---

## DAD CAM / VHS QUESTIONS

### Q: What is "Dad Cam"?

**A:** Dad Cam is our VHS-style wedding videography. We film your entire day handheld, like a family member would—candid, authentic, no staging.

You get a 60-90 minute timeline edit that feels like a home video from the '90s, complete with VHS color grading and aesthetic.

---

### Q: Is it shot on actual VHS tape?

**A:** We shoot on cameras that mimic the VHS look, then add authentic VHS color grading and aesthetic in post-production.

We don't shoot on actual VHS tape (the format is too unreliable and degrades over time), but the final result looks identical to real VHS.

---

### Q: Can I get my wedding on an actual VHS tape?

**A:** Yes! For $400, we can deliver your film on VHS (or DVD/Blu-ray) in a custom box. It plays on any VHS player.

This is an incredibly popular add-on—couples love giving the VHS tape to their parents as a gift.

---

### Q: What's "Wedding Week Dad Cam"?

**A:** We send you a Dad Cam (handheld camcorder) to use for 10 days around your wedding.

You can film rehearsal dinner, brunch, getting ready, family moments—anything you want. Send the camera back to us, and we'll edit all that footage into your final wedding film.

It's $800 and gives you comprehensive coverage of your entire wedding weekend, not just the day-of.

---

## MIXED MEDIA QUESTIONS

### Q: What is Mixed Media?

**A:** Mixed Media combines Super 8, VHS/Dad Cam, and Modern Digital into one seamless, signature highlight film.

We shoot all three mediums throughout your day, then edit a 6-8+ minute film that blends the aesthetics together—timeless Super 8 grain, nostalgic VHS warmth, and crisp 4K digital clarity.

It's the ultimate wedding film experience.

---

### Q: Can I choose which 2 mediums for the 2-Medium package?

**A:** Yes! You can pick any combination:
- Super 8 + Modern Digital (most popular)
- Super 8 + Dad Cam
- Dad Cam + Modern Digital

The 3-Medium package includes all three.

---

### Q: Why do you need 2 videographers for Mixed Media?

**A:** Shooting multiple mediums simultaneously requires coordination and coverage from different angles.

One videographer might be shooting Super 8 during golden hour while the other captures digital footage of guests. Two videographers ensure we don't miss anything and can switch between mediums fluidly.

---

---

### Q: What happens on our wedding day?

**A:** We'll arrive about 1 hour before you start getting dressed (or whenever coverage begins) and stay through the end of formal events (usually ~1 hour after reception ends).

We blend into the background and capture real moments as they happen. You probably won't notice us most of the day—which is exactly what we want!

We'll chat about your timeline, must-have moments, and any special requests 30 days before your wedding.

---

### Q: Do you need a meal at our wedding?

**A:** If we're filming for 6+ hours, we appreciate being included in your vendor meal count. It keeps our energy up and ensures we don't miss key moments!

We're happy to eat wherever vendors are set up—we don't need a seat at a guest table.

---

### Q: Can we request specific songs for our film?

**A:** Absolutely! We'll ask about your song preferences before editing.

Keep in mind: Some songs have licensing restrictions for use in wedding films. We'll let you know if there are any issues and suggest alternatives.

---

### Q: What if we have special requests or unique moments to capture?

**A:** Tell us everything! We send a detailed questionnaire 60 days before your wedding where you can share:
- Must-have moments
- Family dynamics we should know about
- Special traditions or surprises
- Anything else that matters to you

The more we know, the better we can tell your story.
