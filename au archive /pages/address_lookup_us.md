- Objective
	- Searchable database of US locations and regions for autofill, normalization, and mapping.
- Script
	- addresslookup.py
- Database
	- address_lookup_us.db
- Tables
	- countries
		- Rows:
			- US
		- Optional: GPS boundary via boundaries table
	- states
		- All 50 states (+ DC if you want)
		- Optional: GPS boundaries via boundaries table
	- regions
		- Holds ALL region types:
			- Census divisions (9)
			- Directional regions (14)
				- Cardinals
					- North
					- South
					- East
					- West
				- Intercardinals
					- Northeast
					- Northwest
					- Southeast
					- Southwest
				- Pure Central
					- Central
				- Cardinal + Central
					- North Central
					- South Central
					- East Central
					- West Central
				- (Note: don’t list Central twice)
			- Cultural regions
				- Custom per-state regions (e.g. Finger Lakes, Southern Tier)
				- States may be N/A
				- GPS boundaries (can be guesstimated)
			- User regions
				- User-defined regions
				- GPS boundaries
		- Columns (conceptual):
			- id
			- name
			- slug
			- level    ( 'census_div', 'directional', 'cultural', 'user' )
			- state_id (nullable; used for cultural/user regions)
			- description
	- region_members
		- Connects regions to actual geography:
			- region_id
			- state_id (nullable)
			- county_id (nullable)
			- city_id (nullable)
		- Examples:
			- “Finger Lakes” = these counties
			- “North” = these counties or states
			- “User Region A” = these cities
	- counties
		- All counties
		- state_id
		- Optional: GPS boundaries via boundaries table
	- cities
		- City/place names, tied to state and (optionally) county
	- zips
		- ZIP codes mapped to state / city / county
	- boundaries
		- Unified GPS boundaries / polygons for:
			- countries  (ref_type='country')
			- states     (ref_type='state')
			- counties   (ref_type='county')
			- regions    (ref_type='region')
		- Columns (conceptual):
			- id
			- ref_type  ('country' | 'state' | 'county' | 'region')
			- ref_id
			- geom      (GeoJSON or WKB polygon)
	- fts_search
		- FTS table indexing:
			- states
			- counties
			- cities
			- zips
			- regions (including user regions)
		- For fast autocomplete across everything.
