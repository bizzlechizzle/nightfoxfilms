Cadis Baptist Church is a rural Baptist church located in Rome, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1834, its congregation was initially known as the First Free Will Baptist Church of Windham. The church building was constructed in 1881 in the town of Mecca, retaining the same name. Over the years, many of the pastors were recent graduates of Bible Colleges, such as Practical Bible College in Johnson City, NY, and Baptist Bible College in Clarks Summit, PA.

Regrettably, in March 2003, Cadis Baptist Church closed its doors due to a combination of dwindling membership and the challenge of securing a pastor willing to serve in such a small community.
