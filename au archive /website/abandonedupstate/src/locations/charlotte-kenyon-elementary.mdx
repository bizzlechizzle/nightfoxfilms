Charlotte Kenyon Elementary opened in 1929 as Chenango Forks Central School, a riverside campus built to consolidate classrooms across the valley. The district renamed the building in 1978 to honor Charlotte Kenyon, a beloved teacher and principal who guided Forks students for more than four decades, keeping music, art, and community events rooted in the brick halls along Main Street.

When the elementary grades shifted to a new facility in 2002, the landmark beside the Chenango River fell quiet. Explorers still find the auditorium stage dressed for assemblies, cafeteria murals celebrating the region's canal and rail heritage, and stacks of chairs left in basement classrooms - scenes documented by urban explorers in the mid-2010s.

Redevelopment plans have surfaced repeatedly, from community center concepts to a 2022 proposal for workforce housing, yet water intrusion, asbestos abatement, and financing hurdles continue to stall construction. Until a viable reuse secures funding, Charlotte Kenyon Elementary remains a time capsule for the village and alumni advocating for its revival.
