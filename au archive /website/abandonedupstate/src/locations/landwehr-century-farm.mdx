1800's Yellow Brick Farmhouse

The Landwehr House is an abandoned farm in Stearns County, Minnesota. In 1859, Henry Landwehr ventured to St. Augusta township, where he acquired 160 acres and built a yellow brick farmhouse. The Landwehr legacy endured through successive generations, with Landwehr men and their families committing their lives to the farm. This longstanding tradition concluded with the passing of Roman Landwehr on June 14th, 2014.

Subsequently, his wife Angie reached out to the Stearns History Museum, seeking recognition for the farm as a century farm — a title bestowed upon farm families that have maintained ownership of at least 50 acres continuously for 100 years or more.
