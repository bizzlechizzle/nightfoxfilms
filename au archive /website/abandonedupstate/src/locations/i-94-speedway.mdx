The I-94 Speedway, also known as the I-94 Raceway, sat along Interstate 94 just west of Sauk Centre, Minnesota. Amphitheater-style bleachers wrapped the 3/8-mile oval when it opened in 1991, and the new surface quickly drew comparisons to national short tracks. Within a year the promoters converted the clay into asphalt, making I-94 Minnesota's first paved speedway and a regional destination for touring series.

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s the oval hosted NASCAR Midwest Series dates, ASA Midwest Tour stops, ARTGO late models, and hometown divisions. Ownership changes in 2009 brought another dramatic shift: the track reclaimed the Speedway name, tore out the asphalt, and went back to a clay surface. The gambit never regained its former crowds; by the end of that same season the lights went dark for good and the facility slipped into disrepair.

Today the painted walls, sponsor boards, and Miller Lite scoreboard fade in the prairie sun, while grass pushes through the fractured turns and aluminum planks. Shuttered concession stands, empty flag and scoring towers, and wind-worn grandstands now overlook a silent oval that once echoed each Saturday night.
