The Ransom House is an abandoned residence located in Tioga County, New York. Constructed in 1830, it is alleged to have been the former home of slaves owned by Colonel William Ransom. The last occupants, Marvin and Beatrice Godfrey, operated a print shop from the house for decades. "Marvelous Marv" gained local notoriety for his eccentricity and involvement in various ventures within the community.
