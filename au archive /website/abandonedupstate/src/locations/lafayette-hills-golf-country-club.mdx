LaFayette Hills Golf & Country Club, nestled in Jamesville, New York, was a semi-private golf course established in 1923. It featured an 18-hole layout designed by Seymour Dunn, spanning 6,550 yards with a par of 71. Despite its amenities like a driving range, snack bar, and clubhouse lounges, the club faced a sharp decline in membership that culminated in its closure. A tax dispute with the city of Syracuse and an exodus of members—from 350 golfers to none by 2013—left the course abandoned.
