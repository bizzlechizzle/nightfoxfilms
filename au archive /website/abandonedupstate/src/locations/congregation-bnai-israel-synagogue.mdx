Built in 1928 for Congregation Ahavas Achim Anshi Austria, the brick synagogue at 692 Joseph Avenue quickly became known as Congregation B'Nai Israel. It rose alongside thriving kosher markets and delis that once lined the corridor, and its twin entrance towers, stained glass, and meticulously numbered pews reflected the optimism of Rochester's north-side Jewish community.

For decades the sanctuary hosted religious services, fundraisers, and neighborhood meetings, even as families gradually relocated to the suburbs following World War II. By the late twentieth century the congregation had merged elsewhere, yet locals continued to refer to the Joseph Avenue landmark as Temple B'Nai Israel—a name that still appears in community directories and on neighborhood tours. Subsequent church congregations kept the lights on for a time before deferred maintenance took its toll on the plaster, flooring, and balcony railings captured in these photographs.

Today a coalition led by the Joseph Avenue Arts and Culture Alliance is working to stabilize the structure and reimagine it as a performing arts center and heritage hub. The effort has already earned recognition through a William G. Pomeroy Foundation historic marker and documentation on regional heritage registers, ensuring the story of Rochester's oldest surviving purpose-built synagogue remains in public view while plans for revival move forward.
