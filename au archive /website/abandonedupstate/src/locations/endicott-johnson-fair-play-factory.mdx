The Fair Play Factory, an abandoned shoe manufacturing facility in West Endicott, New York, was originally established and operated by the Endicott-Johnson Corporation. EJ Shoes held a prominent position as the nation's leading shoe manufacturer and a significant advocate of welfare capitalism during its heyday.

Officially opening its doors on Monday, June 4th, 1923, the factory had an intriguing start. An April 1923 article from the News Dispatch reported that, although not fully completed, workers were already engaged in shoemaking within the new facility. Its initial operation aimed to provide employment for 1000 individuals and produce over 7000 pairs of shoes daily.

In October 2018 the Fair Play Factory met its end when it was demolished to make room for the new headquarters of National Pipe & Plastics.
