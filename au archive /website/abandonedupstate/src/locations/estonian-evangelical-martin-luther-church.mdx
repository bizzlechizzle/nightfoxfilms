First Estonian Church in North America

The Estonian Evangelical Martin Luther Church is located in Gleason, Wisconsin. Established in 1907, it is the first Estonian church on record in North America. The land was deeded by Sig and Tena Heineman to a group of immigrants from the Baltic Nations to support their faith. The property was later deeded to Evangelical Martin Luther, where the church gained its name, on July 16th, 1914. This original church is the same structure standing today.

When two prominent members of the Church decided to support a new church, almost all activity at the church ceased. It was a core wish of one of the founding fathers that the church always remain a landmark and reminder of Estonian roots in America. Unfortunately, attempts to restore the church have continued since the early 90's and thus far have been unsuccessful.
