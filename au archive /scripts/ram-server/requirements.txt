# RAM++ Local Inference Requirements
# For Mac with MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) acceleration
# IMPORTANT: Use Python 3.12 (not 3.14) for compatibility

# Core PyTorch (MPS support included by default on Apple Silicon)
torch>=2.0.0
torchvision>=0.15.0

# Image processing
Pillow>=9.0.0

# RAM++ dependencies
scipy>=1.10.0
timm>=0.9.0
fairscale>=0.4.0

# Transformers (4.39.x compatible with RAM++)
transformers>=4.25.0,<4.40.0
tokenizers>=0.15.0,<0.16.0

# RAM++ (Recognize Anything Model) - REQUIRED for full model
# pip install git+https://github.com/xinyu1205/recognize-anything.git

# Model weights (2.8GB) - download manually:
# curl -L -o ram_plus_swin_large_14m.pth "https://huggingface.co/xinyu1205/recognize-anything-plus-model/resolve/main/ram_plus_swin_large_14m.pth"

# Setup venv with Python 3.12:
#   python3.12 -m venv venv
#   source venv/bin/activate
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#   pip install git+https://github.com/xinyu1205/recognize-anything.git
#   curl -L -o ram_plus_swin_large_14m.pth "https://huggingface.co/xinyu1205/recognize-anything-plus-model/resolve/main/ram_plus_swin_large_14m.pth"
