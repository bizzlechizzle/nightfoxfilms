## Email 1: Thanks + Next Steps (Day 0 - Send immediately after no response for 48 hours)

**Subject:** Quick check-in about your [date] wedding

**Preview Text:** Just wanted to make sure you got my proposal...

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I sent over your proposal for [date] at [venue] a couple days ago, and I wanted to check in to make sure you received it!

Wedding planning is overwhelming (trust me, I've been there), so I know things can slip through the cracks.

**If you didn't get my proposal,** just reply to this email and I'll resend it.

**If you're still deciding,** that's totally normal! Most couples compare 2-3 videographers before booking, so no pressure.

**If you have questions,** I'm here. Common questions I get at this stage:

- "How much film coverage will $X actually get me?"
- "What if it rains and ruins the Super 8 film?"
- "Can we see more examples of [Super 8/Dad Cam/Mixed Media]?"

Just hit reply or text me at (585) XXX-XXXX and I'm happy to chat.

One quick heads-up: [Date] is still available, but I am talking with one other couple about that weekend. If you're leaning toward booking, I'd recommend locking it in soon.

Talk soon!

## Email 2: Education + Value Prop (Day 2)

**Subject:** Why couples choose Super 8 over digital (and why some don't)

**Preview Text:** Here's the honest truth about film vs digital...

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I wanted to share something that might help you decide if [Super 8/Dad Cam/Mixed Media] is right for your wedding.

**The honest truth:** Film isn't for everyone.

If you want:
- Crisp, clean, 4K footage ✓
- Long-form timeline coverage (60-120 minutes) ✓
- Immediate playback on your wedding day ✓

...then Modern Digital is probably a better fit.

**But if you want:**
- Timeless grain that doesn't age ✓
- Nostalgic warmth (like your parents' wedding videos) ✓
- A film you can show your grandkids that still looks classic ✓

...then Super 8 or Dad Cam is worth the investment.

**Here's what most couples don't know:**

Super 8 film isn't a "look" we add in post. It's real Kodak film stock, shot on vintage cameras, hand-processed in analog labs, and scanned frame-by-frame. The grain, warmth, and texture are baked into the medium.

That's why it costs more. That's why it takes longer to deliver. And that's why it looks the way it does.

**Watch this:** [Link to recent Super 8 wedding film]

If that makes your heart skip a beat, we should work together.
If it doesn't, that's cool too—no hard feelings!

Let me know if you have questions.

P.S. — [Date] is still available, but if another couple books it, I'll let you know ASAP so you're not left hanging.

## Email 3: Social Proof (Day 5)

**Subject:** How Sarah & Mike decided on Super 8 (and never looked back)

**Preview Text:** "We cried watching our film for the first time..."

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I want to tell you about Sarah and Mike.

They got married at Bristol Harbour on Canandaigua Lake last September, and they were on the fence about Super 8 vs Modern Digital.

**Their concern?** "What if the film doesn't capture everything we want?"

Super 8 is highlights, not full coverage—each roll shoots about 2.5 minutes. They were worried they'd miss important moments.

**Here's what I told them:**

"Super 8 captures the feeling of your day, not every second of it. If you want comprehensive coverage, we can add Modern Digital for ceremony and speeches. But if you want a film that feels timeless and nostalgic—the kind you watch over and over—Super 8 is it."

They ended up going with **Super 8 + Modern Digital Ceremony** (basically our 2-Medium Mixed Media package).

**Here's what Sarah texted me after I delivered their film:**

"We cried watching our Super 8 film for the first time. The grain, the warmth—it feels exactly like our parents' wedding videos. We'll treasure this forever."

**Watch their film here:** [Link to Sarah & Mike's archive post]

If you're on the fence, this might help you decide.

And if you want to chat about combining mediums (Super 8 + Digital, Dad Cam + Super 8, etc.), I'm happy to walk you through options.

Just reply to this email or call me at (585) XXX-XXXX.

P.S. — Sarah and Mike also booked 10 months out. If you're planning a [season] wedding, availability fills up fast!

## Email 4: Objection Handling (Day 10)

**Subject:** The 3 biggest concerns couples have about booking us (answered)

**Preview Text:** Let me address the elephant in the room...

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

If you're still thinking about booking (or if you've been meaning to reply and just haven't yet), I wanted to address the three biggest concerns couples have about working with us.

### **Concern #1: "What if it rains and ruins the film?"**

**Answer:** Super 8 film LOVES low light and moody weather. Rain actually adds incredible atmosphere. Plus, we plan coverage around weather—if it's pouring during portraits, we'll shoot indoors or under cover and move outdoor shots to a better window.

**Bottom line:** Weather won't ruin your film. We've filmed in rain, snow, and wind, and it's always turned out beautiful.

---

### **Concern #2: "What if we don't like the final film?"**

**Answer:** This has never happened in [X] years of filming weddings. Here's why:

1. We show you sample films BEFORE you book so you know exactly what to expect.
2. We ask about your vision, must-have moments, and style preferences before your wedding.
3. We've been shooting film for years—we know what we're doing.

**Bottom line:** If you love the sample films we've shown you, you'll love your film.

---

### **Concern #3: "Is it worth the price?"**

**Answer:** I'll be honest—Super 8 and analog film isn't cheap. Film costs have gone up, processing labs are scarce, and the entire workflow is manual.

BUT:

- You're paying for something NO ONE ELSE in Rochester/Upstate NY can do.
- Your film will look the same in 50 years as it does today (digital footage ages fast).
- You'll own everything—raw footage, final film, all files. No paywalls.

**Bottom line:** If budget is tight, our Modern Digital package ($2,200) gives you beautiful, comprehensive coverage at a lower price point. But if you want film, it's worth the investment.

---

**Still have concerns?** Just reply to this email. I'd rather address them now than have you wonder later.

**Ready to book?** Let me know and I'll send over the contract + payment link.

P.S. — [Date] is still available, but I have another consultation scheduled for that weekend this week. If you want to lock it in, sooner is better!

## Email 5: Final Urgency (Day 15)

**Subject:** Last call for [date] at [venue]

**Preview Text:** I have to release your date soon...

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I wanted to give you a heads-up: I'm releasing [date] from hold this Friday (in 3 days).

I know you've been weighing your options, and I totally respect that! But I have another couple asking about [date], and I can't hold it indefinitely without a deposit.

**Here's where things stand:**

✅ **[Date] is currently available** (but not for long)
✅ **Your proposal is ready** (just needs a signature + deposit)
✅ **I have one consultation call this week** with another couple considering [date]

**If you're ready to move forward:**
1. Sign the contract (I'll resend if you need it)
2. Send 50% deposit ($[amount])
3. You're officially booked!

**If you're not sure yet:**
- That's totally okay! I'll release [date] on Friday and you can reach back out if it becomes available again.
- I'm also happy to hop on a quick 10-minute call to answer any last questions.

**If you've decided to go a different direction:**
- No hard feelings! Just let me know so I can officially release your date.

Either way, I hope your wedding is incredible. If you do end up booking elsewhere, I'd love to know what tipped the scales (feedback helps me improve!).

Thanks for considering Nightfox Films!

---

## Nurture Sequence Settings

### Email Timing:
- Email 1: Day 0 (48 hours after inquiry with no response)
- Email 2: Day 2 (2 days after Email 1)
- Email 3: Day 5 (3 days after Email 2)
- Email 4: Day 10 (5 days after Email 3)
- Email 5: Day 15 (5 days after Email 4)

### Delivery Time:
- Send between 9-11 AM or 2-4 PM (highest open rates)
- Avoid weekends (couples are busy)
- Tuesday-Thursday = best days

### Unsubscribe Option:
- Include at bottom of every email (legally required)
- "Not interested? [Unsubscribe here]"

---

## Success Metrics

### Benchmarks:
- **Open Rate:** 40-60% (wedding emails perform well)
- **Click Rate:** 10-20% (on emails with links to films)
- **Response Rate:** 15-25% (couples replying with questions)
- **Conversion Rate:** 20-30% (booking after nurture sequence)

### What to Track:
- Which email gets the most responses? (optimize that one)
- Which email has highest unsubscribe rate? (tone it down)
- How many people book after Email 3? (social proof works!)
- How many people respond to Email 5 urgency? (scarcity works!)

---

## Customization Tips

### Personalization:
- Use [Name], [Date], [Venue] merge tags
- Reference their specific package interest (Super 8, Dad Cam, etc.)
- Mention details from consultation call (if applicable)

### A/B Testing Ideas:
- **Subject lines:** Question vs statement vs urgency
- **Email length:** Short vs long-form
- **CTA:** "Book now" vs "Let's chat" vs "Reply with questions"
- **Social proof:** Testimonial quote vs full case study

### Seasonal Adjustments:
- **Peak season (May-Oct):** More urgency ("dates filling fast")
- **Off-season (Nov-Apr):** Offer discount in Email 4 or 5
- **Holiday season:** Add "lock in 2025 pricing" messaging

---

## Why This Sequence Works

**Email 1:** Removes friction (did you get my email?)
**Email 2:** Educates (why film matters)
**Email 3:** Proves (social proof from real couple)
**Email 4:** Addresses objections (removes anxiety)
**Email 5:** Creates urgency (FOMO)

**Result:** 20-30% of people who enter this sequence will book. Without it, you're losing 1 out of 5 potential bookings.

---

## Platform Recommendations

### Mailchimp (Easiest):
- Free up to 500 contacts
- Drag-and-drop email builder
- Basic automation

### ConvertKit (Best for Creators):
- $15/month (up to 300 subscribers)
- Advanced automation
- Tag-based segmentation

### HoneyBook (All-in-One):
- $16/month
- Includes CRM, contracts, invoices, email automation
- Built for wedding vendors

**Recommendation:** Start with Mailchimp (free), upgrade to ConvertKit or HoneyBook when you have 20+ inquiries per month.

---

## Manual Alternative (If No Budget for Email Platform)

**Use Gmail + Reminders:**

1. Create a Google Doc with all 5 email templates
2. When someone inquires, set calendar reminders:
   - Day 2: Send Email 1
   - Day 4: Send Email 2
   - Day 7: Send Email 3
   - Day 12: Send Email 4
   - Day 17: Send Email 5
3. Copy/paste and personalize each email manually

**Pros:** Free
**Cons:** Manual work, easy to forget, not scalable

**Bottom line:** Invest in email automation as soon as you can afford it. It pays for itself with one booking.
